        <h4><p>When ever you play up in age, you are giving away speed and size to the other teams.  It puts more pressure on you to play disciplined soccer.  That’s exactly what we had to do in the Lancaster tournament.  The competition was outstanding and we rose to the occasion to become champions.  </p><p>
Against Tritown we controlled play, but that means nothing if you can’t score.  Part of the problem with a tournament is you feel a sense of urgency to score quickly because the halfs are only 30 minutes. We were forcing everything forward, and rushing down the field and blindly crossing to no one.  Once we settled in, and started keeping the ball on the ground things changed.  Hats off to their keeper.  He played high like a sweeper making it difficult to attack the space behind their defense.  </p><p>
Our next game was our best.  Against Clarence we just clicked.  Scoring our first goal 30 seconds into the game, on a six player series of one\two touch passes that led to the goal.  From their it just continued.  Excellent chemistry in this games.
</p><p>
The semifinal was against Lancaster, and they gave us all we could handle.  Their defense was big, fast and strong.  No easy goals were going to happen in this game.  We had to work for everything.  Lancaster plays the finest offsides trap I have ever seen from a youth team.  Having just played them Thursday we expected this, and used our midfielders coming from depth to breakthrough.   The final was 4 -2, but it was one of the toughest games we’ve had all season.   
</p><p>
The final made us feel like Belgium playing the USA.  Their goalie was phenomenal.  We had numerous point blank chances, but couldn’t get any by him.  He even saved a pk and actually caught the ball.  The game ended 1 – 0, but not from lack of chances.  </p><p>
Congratulations to the boys.  Anything can happen at a tournament.  You can get a small field.  You can face an amazing keeper.  You can face a well coached defense.  You can lose on pk’s.  You are always one mistake from losing and being eliminated.  We won this tournament.  Any time you do that, you should celebrate.  Congratulations, job well done!!!
