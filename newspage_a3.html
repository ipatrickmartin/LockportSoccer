        <h4><p>State Cup was our focus this season and the kids really rose to the occasion.  We played our Epic final right before the playdown games began and that really seemed to focus the team.  Our first playdown game was in the pouring rain against NYPS.  The weather conditions, our size, speed and aggresiveness were too much for them and we won 7-1.  Next we played SDA.  Coming into that game we felt whomever won that match would win State Cup. We came in fired up and from the opening kickoff it was a completely one sided game.  SDA gave us all they had, but that game was all ours.  Two beautiful breakaway goals and a free kick from Josh that was worthy of sportscenter highlights.</p>  <p>At State Cup we started with the defending Champions.  We played on a beautiful field.  We started a little rough for the first ten minutes, but then the game was all ours.  Joe started us off with a great run up the middle for a goal.  Max buried a header on a corner, and Adam put them away with a breakaway at the end.  On a beautiful field the better team will usually win and that was the case.</p><p>Empire Buffalo was next.  Being from the same area, they always play us tough.  This game was played on turf and both teams struggled at first adjusting to the bouncing ball.  Their main threat was a fast striker.  Our sweeper Garrett was out with the flu, which made it challenging for our defense.  In the first half we controlled the game, but couldn't finish.  The second half we finally got on the scoreboard with a 12 pass give and go combination that was soccer at it's finest.  Trevor finished that off tapping it home from the six.</p><p>Sunday morning was for all the marbles.  All we needed was a tie and we would advance.  We chose to take the uphill and the wind in our face to start.  Hindsight being what it is, we should have played more defensive and weathered the storm.  We chose to play and in the 25 minute they scored on us.  The second half the kids came out fired up.  We sat in their end almost the entire time, we just couldn't put one away.  A credit to their defense.  I thought for the most part the ref did a good job, but they got a very questionable free kick later that led to a goal.  After that we sent everybody up but still couldn't get one in.  They got a counter attack PK goal at the end to finish the game.  I believe 9 out of 10 times we play that team we would win.  Unfortunately Sunday wasn't our day.  Still the kids left it all on the field and we will be back next year.  </p>  </h4>
