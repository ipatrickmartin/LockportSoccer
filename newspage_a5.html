        <h4><p>Webster is my favorite tournament.  It's the closest, most competitive tournament around.  Plus it's 5 minutes from Webster Park campgrounds.  Coming into this we saw that we got an easy draw in pool play.  Honestly that isn't always a good thing.  We took our first game way too lightly and that almost caught up with us.  To their credit they are well coached and didn't make it easy for us.</p>  <p>Between games, we had a nice cookout back at the campsite.  It's a nice place to get out of the sun and relax.  It did the trick because we were all business our second game.  Soaring Capitals had some good athletes, but we owned that game scoring two goals in the first 5 minutes.</p><p>That night the boys camped out.  We didn't see any bears, but the boys found some girls, so pulling them back to the campsite proved harded than we first thought.  They stayed up late, but they all had a lot of fun.</p><p>The next day we won our last pool game making us 3-0 and sending us to the semi finals.  All tournament we played on big nice fields.  For the semi-finals, they put us on a small dumpy field.  Both our team and Empire Rochester could tell you, that field took the skill right out of the game.  We scored twice during the game with one being called offsides.  Definitely a questionable call.  Then Jona scored with 5 minutes left to ice the game, or so we thought.  A hail Mary long ball by them took a rock ground bounce and went over Stevie's head and in.  We went through overtime and on to pk's.  We did a great job in pk's and Kyle iced it with the final pk.  Both teams were exhausted when this ended.</p><p>The final was played on a giant field.  Joe came down with the stomache flu and had to sit this game out.  I think that, and the exhausting nature of the SemiFinal game took us out of our game.  We gave up an early break away goal and then they got the worst PK call I have ever seen.  The head ref was right there and waived it off, but the linesman called it a PK.  The linesman admitted Max got all ball, but gave it to them anyway because maxs stud were up.  Which wasn't the case and they didn't touch the kid anyway.  It's a championship game, he should have let the center ref do his job and stayed out of it.  That was a young ref in over his head.  At halftime we switched to a 3-5-2 which really helped.  On a huge field we were too defensive, and that helped us generate more chances.  We ended up losing, but learned a lot from the game, and the kids still came away with a positive experience.  That's what it's all about.</p></h4>
